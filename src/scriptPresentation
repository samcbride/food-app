Hey guys, we are here to present our final project: 'What's in your cupboard', a food recipe finder. 

We dedicated the first meeting to establish the objectives of what we though it could be reasonable to achieve in a period of 2-3 weeks:

//Use a presentation-animation of the objectives //

- An app easy to use for everyone
- Displayed for all types of devices
- Some type of funny extra ('random button')
- Some accesibility ('health labels')

With the objectives in mind we started drawing the first sketch of the app // introduce Miro board image // and we identified the components we wanted to develop:

// For each component, show two windows, one with the component set up in the screen and the other with the code //

- A search bar and button  where to introduce the ingredients and click 


- A recipe where to store the results of the search.


- The results of the search

- The two extras to add something more: a random button that would show a recipe randomized and a variety of labels to filter your search across your dietary restrictions.

- Also, for a matter of convenience and time we decided to look for a third-party API that would allow us to search a database. We chose Edamam because its documentation was easy to understand and had a wide variety of extras. //show Edamam label //

For request we used the method axios
